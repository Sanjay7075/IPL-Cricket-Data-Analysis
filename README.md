Bar charts helped compare team performance across different IPL seasons.
Line graphs showed the trends in matches played and team win rates over the years.
3️⃣ Key Insights from the Data
✅ Mumbai Indians & Chennai Super Kings are the most successful IPL teams.
✅ Teams winning the toss often choose to bowl first to chase the target.
✅ IPL matches have increased over the years, showing the league’s growing popularity.

4️⃣ Power BI for Interactive Dashboards
Created a Power BI dashboard to visualize team performance, top players, and toss impact.
